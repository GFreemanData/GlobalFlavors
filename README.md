Global Flavors Data Analysis Project for Taste of the World Cafe
Project Context
In my role as a Data Analyst for Taste of the World Cafe, a restaurant celebrated for its diverse menu and generous portions, I embarked on the "Global Flavors Data Analysis Project". The project was initiated in response to the cafe's recent introduction of a new menu, with the goal of understanding customer reactions and menu item performance.
Assignment Overview
The assignment involved delving into customer order data following the launch of the new menu. The aim was to discern which items were favorites among customers and which were underperforming, thereby informing potential menu optimizations.
Objectives
Exploring the New Menu: Analyze the menu_items table for insights into the variety and pricing of the new offerings.
Understanding Customer Orders: Investigate the order_details table to understand customer purchasing patterns.
Combining Insights: Use both tables to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer responses to the new menu.
Methodology and Findings
Developed a MySQL database to store and analyze the restaurant's data.
Conducted detailed SQL queries to uncover insights:
Menu Item Analysis: Revealed that the menu offers a diverse range of items, with certain high-priced items like "Shrimp Scampi" and "Korean Beef Bowl" being the most expensive, and more affordable options like "Edamame" and "French Fries" at the lower end of the price spectrum.
Order Details Analysis: Determined the total number of unique orders made and found patterns in item sales. Discovered key periods of customer ordering, providing insights into peak business times.
Joint Data Analysis: Combined data from both tables to identify top-selling and least-selling items. Found that some high-priced items were among the top sellers, indicating customer willingness to purchase premium dishes. Conversely, some less expensive items were not as popular, suggesting a mismatch between price and customer preference.
Conclusions
The analysis identified Italian and Asian cuisine as the top selling items with Italian being the top. This suggests that adding new Italian cuisine is a safe choice.
Identified underperforming items, suggesting a need to either improve or consider removing them from the menu.
Customer preferences for certain items over others, regardless of price, indicated the importance of taste and quality in driving sales.
Impact and Recommendations
This project provided Taste of the World Cafe with actionable insights, enabling them to refine their menu based on customer preferences and sales data. Recommendations include focusing on high-value items from popular categories, reassessing less popular dishes, and considering customer feedback for continuous menu improvement.
